# Projects

## Project 1: Bunching behaviour in parkrun

Theories of reference-dependent preferences suggest that individuals evaluate outcomes relative to a reference point, contrary to classical utility theory assumptions. Evidence from marathon runners indicates clustering around specific finishing times, supporting this theory. This analysis explores seasonality effects and gender differences in bunching behavior in parkrun events, revealing significant clustering around specific minute intervals. While this analysis adds to the evidence supporting reference-dependent theories in running sports, further investigation into the underlying mechanisms of bunching is hindered by data limitations.


## Project 2: Analysing the effect of seller reputation on bidding behavior in eBay’s used car Auctions

This study, using data from the UK eBay car auction market, examined the relationship between seller reputation and auction outcomes. Using the robust analytical tool of quartile regression, the study found that sellers with exclusively positive feedback tend to sell their products at higher prices compared to those with tarnished reputations. Furthermore, using a negative binomial, the research shows that this price difference is not due to attracting more bidders as the results suggest that seller reputation doesn't influence the number of bidders. However, when competing for item marketed by a seller with good reputations, bidders use a more aggressive bidding strategy, resulting in higher bid increments. This suggests that the price premium associated with good seller reputations is linked to a more competitive bidding approach, even though the number of bidders remains relatively constant.
